/** \defgroup tuples Tuplespace layer

    \brief This is the public interface to the tuplespace layer of the peiskernel. 

    The tuplespace is implemented on top of the \ref P2PLayer 
    "P2P layer" and implementation details can be found in the \ref
    tuples_internal "Tuplespace internals". 
    
    From the perspective of the tuplespace keys consists of three
    parts: (name, owner, data) where \em name is a string key for the
    tuple, \em owner is the address of a peis responsible for this
    tuple (see below) and data is the value of the tuple. The tuples
    are indexed by \em name and \em owner meaning that tuples with the
    same name but different owners are allowed to coexist while there
    can (ideally) only be one instance at a time of tuples with the
    same \em name, \em owner (but different data).
    
    
    There are (currently) two basic methods that tuple values are
    propagated.
    - The \em owner peis writes to the tuple and the updated value is
    propagated to all \em subscribed peis.
    - A peis writes to the tuple by sending a message to the \em owner
    peis which stores the last written value and propagates it to all
    \em subscribed peis. The message passing is handled transparantly
    be the peis kernel and is not visible to the application other than
   by a delay before the value is updated in the local tupelspace.
   
   The \em owner of a tuple can always access the latest value of that
   tuple by a direct memory access. In order for other peis to have
   access the latest value of a tuple they need to be subscribed to the
   tuple. Subscriptions are established by calling peisk_subscribe()
   which will make sure that subscription messages are reguarly sent to
   relevant parts of the network. Subscriptions come in two varieties:
   - Qualified subscribtion to (\em name, \em owner) tuples. These
   subscriptions are in essence a direct oneway communication from the
   owner of the tuple to the receiving peis which will get the latest
   value of all written tuple values.
   - Wildcard subscriptions (\em name, *) which registers a
   subscription with all peis on the network. All matching produced
   tuples will be propagated to this peis. 
   
   Corresponding to these two subscription mechanism tuples can also
   be accessed by a call to peisk_getTuple(). We have four cases:
   - A peis accessing a tuple with itself as \em owner. Returns the
   last value written to the tuple by itself or by some other peis
   writing to the tuple (and propagating the message to this owner). 
   - A peis accessing a tuple with another peis as \em owner. Returns
   the last value of the tuple that has been propagated from the owner
   to this peis. 
   - Accessing a tuple with a wildcard (-1) as \em owner. Returns a
   value for each owner that has propagated a value for this \em
   keyname to this peis.
   
   Note that the last two accesses requires active subscriptions in
   order to receive the \em correct value. 

   Everyone interested in data should subscribe to key(s)
   periodically. Everyone producing data should send a copy of it to
   everyone currently subscribed to it.
   
   \section Special tuples
   There exists a number of special tuples maintained automatically by
   the peiskernel to give information about the internal state of this
   peis. All of these special tuples have the prefix "peiskernel."

   - peiskernel.all-keys: The value of this tuple is managed by the peiskernel
   and is always maintained as a lisp-list of the names of all
   currently available tuples.
   - peiskernel.connections: Gives connection and traffic information
     about all currently established network connections
   - peiskernel.do-quit: if set to "yes" this forces the application
   to exist.
   - peiskernel.hostname: gives the hostname of this peis
   - peiskernel.name: gives the application name of this component
   - peiskernel.routingTable: gives routing information to tupleview,
   mainly for debugging
   - peiskernel.step-time: gives an indication of how often the kernel
   is executing, must be below 0.1 at all times. Preferably below
   0.01. 
   - peiskernel.subscribers: gives a list of all peis currently
   subscribed to any tuples in this peis ownership.
   - peiskernel.traffic: gives traffic statistics
   - peiskernel.user: gives the username (if appropriate) of the user
   running this component/application
   - peiskernel.version: shows the compile version of this kernel
