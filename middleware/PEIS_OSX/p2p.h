/** \defgroup P2PLayer The P2P layer
    \brief The middle layer of the peiskernel consists of a basic P2P
    overlay network which uses any forms of network links provided
    by the lowermost overlay link layer to create an ad-hoc P2P layer
    discovering and connecting all PEIS. 

    It provides these basic API services to other parts of the peis kernel.

    - routing of messages towards destintions multiple hops away

    - port/pin based communication. Any peis can send a message on a
      given port of any other named peis or broadcast on a given port to
      reach all available peis in the environment. The ports typically
      denote different forms of services which the peis provide to the
      ecology. Communication can be initiated with unknown peis by a
      broadcasted request and continued by sending messages back to the replyer.

    - long messages: splits up messages longer than linklayer limit
      (1Kb) into multiple packages sent individually towards
      destination

    - reliable messages: see \ref Acknowledgements for details how
      this is implemented. This allows for the automatic resending of
      messages until they have been acknowledged by the receiver, or
      until a timeout have been reached. In either case, a user
      defined hook can be triggered to deal with the success/failure.

    - port based hooks: calls user defined functions when a package
      belonging to a given port passes through this host. Allows the
      functions to intercept or ignore the packages. 

    - periodic functions: calls user defined functions with a given
      periodicity. Will call the function with _up to_ that
      frequency. In general, we do not call a function multiple times
      in order to "catch up" with it if our step function have been
      called too slowly. This allows for (1) gradual degradation when
      CPU usage is 100% and (2) to register periodics with a period
      time of 0.0 in order to be called on every step.

/** \ingroup P2PLayer */
/** \defgroup Routing Routing Tables
    The P2P layer keeps track of a routing table and propagates these
    along the neighbours links whenever the routing information
    changes. This information is stored in a local hash table.   

    For every other known component a hash table entry is created with
    routing information for this host. The routing information consists of
    the peis-id of the host, the magic number of the host, the sequence
    number of the last known routing information to this host, the
    estimated hops (metric cost) to this host as well as a timer used by
    the known hosts updating service. 
    
    Additionally, a simplified version of this hash table is stored for
    each connection, listing the estimated routing information to this
    host as if it had to go through this connection. 

    A periodic function is used to update the global routing table by
    inserting the local node into it's own routing table and monotonically
    incrementing the corresponding sequence number by one on each
    update. Furthermore, on each update a packed representation of the
    global routing table is computed containing the id,
    last-seen-sequence-number, magic-number, hops and
    estimated-connections for each host. The estimated-connections are
    computed from the connection manager structure for this host if
    available. These packed representations are sent along each connection
    (split into pages that fit within each package size requirement) to
    the direct link layer neighbours without any further propagation.  

    The bandwidth consumed by this module increase linearly by number
    of connections and in thresholds of number of known hosts divided
    by number of hosts that fits in the routing pages.  

    Bandwidth = O( nConnections * floor(hosts / 70) )


    An update to the global routing table is computed on each node
    whenever they receive routing information from the direct
    neighbours. The received routing information is decoded and compared
    to the current routing hash table for that connection and missing
    hosts are marked as outdated by setting their hops to 250. Hosts that
    are not outdated are updated in the connections routing table and a
    check is made to see if the global routing table is updated. This is
    done by comparing the values of seqno – hops for the routing table,
    trying to maximize this value in the global table. This can lead to
    the three cases: (1) no-change required, (2) use this connection
    instead of the current connection or (3) select another connection.  

    This function always maximize seqno – metric, which is
    monotonically increasing in all routing tables. 
    Implications:
      - When a short route to someone is lost, longer routes won't be considered until the seqno has increased.
      - Whenever a node is lost, metrics will increase and seqno stay
        same leading to the connections routing tables to not be updated
        (marking them as outdated) and leading eventual to deletion from
        the global routing table and triggering the internal hooks for
       dead hosts.  

    The magic numbers for hosts are used for detecting the situation
    when a given peis-id is used simultaneously by two different
    nodes, or to detect when a node have stopped and restarted. It is
    also used to prevent propagation of incorrect routing information
    to hosts that have been deleted and restarted.

/** \defgroup Acknowledgements Acknowledgement handling

    Packages sent through the P2P layer of the PeisKernel can be, and
    usually are, sent in "reliable mode". Meaning  
    that they after sending get put on a stack of packages to be
    acknowledged within a given timeframe or they are
    retransmitted. In order to not flood this stack, packages will
    only be retranmissted maximum of PEISK_PENDING_MAX_RETRIES
    times. The retransmission are with an increasing period of
    PEISK_PENDING_RETRY_TIME seconds for the first retry, twice that
    for the second retry, three times that for the third etc. The
    total time packages are kept on the stack are thus
    PEISK_PENDING_RETRY_TIME*(1+2+3+...+PEISK_PENDING_MAX_RETRIES) 

    After receiving an acknowledgement or giving up on a package, a
    peiskernel/expert user defined function may be called with a
    success status of 0 or 1. This is done by registering an
    acknowledgementHook when the package is sent, this hook is kept on
    the stack of packages and called at the relevant future time.

/** \ingroup P2PLayer */
/** \defgroup ConnectionManagement Connection mangement
    Goals: To keep the diameter of the P2P network small (increases
    chance of packages beeing delivered with fewer retries), to keep
    number of connection establishments as small as possible (avoid
    routing table changes, saves OS time) and to have direct
    connections to any hosts with whom we exchange much data (overall
    efficiency of network). Also attempt to keep the number of
    connections in a suitable range (not too few, not too many). 

    Method: minimise diameter, plus establish connections to hosts to
    whom we transmitt much information.

    Keep track of how much traffic (bytes/second) are _routed_ to
    different hosts. This includes all directed messages (not link
    level packages) and routed packages. For hosts that we route more
    than X bytes per second over a sliding window (for a constant X),
    force a connection if possible. 

    To minimise girth: Find the value V(c) of each connection c. The value of
    a connection is the maximum *increase* in metric distance to any
    host which are currently routed through that connection if that
    connection would be closed. This can be computed from the
    connections routing tables. The value of connections to whom we
    have a forced link (data per second > X) have an infinite value. 

    Next, for each known host which we haven't connected to recently: 
    find the value V(h) of establishing a connection to this host h, this
    value is defined as a random number (0-99) plus a constant (100)
    times the current metric to this host minus the guestimated metric
    cost along a direct connection to that host. Hosts that we have
    recently connect to have a value of  zero. This allows for a
    certain randomness in chosing which hosts to connect to, aliasing
    interference patterns from multiple components attempting to
    connect to the same hosts. 

    If we have fewer than the minimum wanted connections (eg. 3) then
    establish a new connection to the host h with the highest value
    V(h). 

    If we have a suitable number of connections (eg. < 7) then
    connect to the host h with the highest value V(h) if this value is
    higher than the lowest V(c) for any connection c. 

    If we have more than a suitable number connections (eg. 7) then
    close the connection with the lowest value (if it not infinite). 

    Idea for load balancing: Keep track of the two or three
    connections which have the lowest metric to any given hosts. Send
    some of the packages through the other metric connections
    (depending on relative metric costs), this might reduce the load
    of the routing hosts and may establish new direct links... 
    Hmm, could be dangerous if bandwidth along each connection becomes too
    low, so the connections get a low value...
