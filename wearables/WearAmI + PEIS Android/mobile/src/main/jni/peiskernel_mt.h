/** \defgroup peiskmt Multithreaded PEIS kernel wrappers
    Provides a wrapper for multithreaded applications to use the PEIS
    kernel safely.

    Most (but not all) operating systems and programming languages
    have an implementation of posix threads, for these systems and
    languages there exists a multithreaded wrapper around the
    peiskernel. This simplifies the use of the peiskernel
    significantly since it eliminates the need to periodcially call
    the peisk_step function from within the application.
    To use these wrappers, make sure to link against -lpeiskernel_mt
    and use only the functions defined in peiskernel_mt.h, all these
    functions have the prefix peiskmt_.

    This library is required when the application nativly uses
    threads and may call kernel functions from any threads.

    When using callbacks some caution should be used. In this
    situation, callbacks etc. can be registered from any thread using
    the peiskmt_ functions. However, since the callbacks will be
    called by an internal peiskernel thread, they must make sure to
    terminate quickly (within approx 10-100ms), OR use the peisk_step
    function internally. Note that inside these callback functions it
    is an error to use any of the multithreaded wrappers, ie. do not
    use the peiskmt_* functions, only the peisk_* functions.
