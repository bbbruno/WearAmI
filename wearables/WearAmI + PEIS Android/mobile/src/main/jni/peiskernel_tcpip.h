/** \defgroup TcpIP  TCP/IPv4

  In the begining only tcp/ip and udp/ip connections between peis
  kernels are handled. However, as time progresses more alternative
  interfaces can be added such as serial radio modems etc.

  When a peis kernel boots up the computer will be queries for all
  currently active network interfaces. These interfaces will be used
  for listening for other active peiskernels on and for multicasting
  messages announcing the presence of this peiskernel. These multicasts
  are usually limited to the local subnet, depending on the
  limitations of any routers on the TCP/IP level, and is a way for ensuring that
  peiskernels automatically connect to each other.
