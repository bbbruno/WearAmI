/** \defgroup NetworkTime Distributed Network Clock
    When communicating data between notes a shared notion of time is
    essential in order to correctly interpret when events and data was
    produced. Unfortunatly the internal clocks of types of devices we
    consider often can differ by several seconds or even minutes due
    to eg. incorrect configurations or a drift of the internal
    clock. In order to compensate for these discrepancies peiskernel
    implements a distributed network clock that is propagated to all
    nodes on the network.

    double peisk_gettimef()
    Returns the current clock value on the network as the number of
    seconds and microseconds elapsed since the unix epoch.

    This clock value is usually monotonically increasing, but can be reset
    to a lower value under a few special situations. When the clock is
    moved in such a case, the timing information inside each tuple is also
    changed accordingly to preserve relative times for creation, expiry
    etc.

    All timing information in tuples and periodics are expressed in
    terms of this network clock and all user programs should use this
    network clock to express time.

    The network clock is effectively computed as a difference between
    the current clock of the host and the agreed upon clock. The
    protocoll for agreeing upon the clock value consists of a simple
    periodic broadcast that is done by one of the PEIS components in
    the network. If a component have recently seen such a broadcast by
    some other component with a higher peis-id then it will not
    broadcast. Otherwise it will send out it's own notion of the
    clock. When a clock value is received it is used to update the
    clock difference only if this would increase it.

    A timemaster is a PEIS component that have been authorative
    information that it's initial clock is correct (eg. from external
    NTP clocks). Time messages from such a component always win over
    timing messages from less authoritative components.

    Note that the distributed clock is only accurate to the latency of
    the network. There is currently no measurement of the network
    latencies or other way of compensating for this time delay.

/** \defgroup Autohost Automatic host connections
    \brief This term refers to a host that the peiskernel will always attempt
    to maintain an active connection to. A built in service
    will monitor this connection and reestablish it whenever it is
    closed.

    The main purpose of estabilishing autohosts are to either (a)
    connect networks which do not talk with  multicasts between each
    other or goes through firewalls or (b) connect to leaf nodes.
