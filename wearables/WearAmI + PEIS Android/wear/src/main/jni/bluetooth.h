/** \ingroup LinkLayer */
/** \defgroup BluetoothLayer Bluetooth layer
    Bluetooth is an alternative link layer that can be used standalone
    or in conjunction with the TCP link layer. The bluetooth link
    layer module is compile time optional, and requires that
    libbluetooth-dev is installed to compile.

    The bluetooth layer can use one or more bluetooth adapters, these
    are given as commandline options using --peis-bluetooth hciX
    where hciX is a specific bluetooth adaptor. Use "hcitool dev" to
    see which bluetooth adaptors are available on your system.
    It can use multiple adaptors by beeing given multiple instances of
    that option. It does not rqeuire to use all adaptors available on
    the local machine.

    Currently, peis components need to be run with root priviliges (!)
    in order to be able to use the bluetooth adaptors, this is
    neccessary to enable RAW interface mode to overcome some of the
    limitations in the current linux bluetooth interface drivers and
    libraries.

    Multiple peiscomponents can be run using the same bluetooth
    adaptors. However, only one component can use the adaptor for
    "broadcasting" that this bluetooth adaptor is connected to a
    PEIS. Currently, the first PEIS that opens the device gets this
    privilege, and hence, when that PEIS is closed no other PEIS will
    make incoming connections to any PEIS on this computer. This can
    be fixed in the future.

    In order to find other PEIS that have bluetooth adaptors, each
    PEIS with an adaptor performs SCAN operations using the bluetooth
    adaptor in RAW mode. This gives a list of all other bluetooth
    devices (not just PEIS) in the vicinity, as well as their signal
    strengths. The signal strenghts are reported as tuples, to be used
    by higher level applications to compute locations of devices.

    By regurarly attempting to connect using L2CAP port 7315 (See \ref
    Hello "HELLO connections) to detected bluetooth devices, it can be
    determined if they are PEIS and basic host information data can be
    transmitted between the two. This also transmits the port numbers
    of any ports for incomming connections.

    By using the signal strengths, and the results of the periodic
    HELLO connections, it is possible to determine with a bluetooth
    connection between two PEIS might be possible. This is reflected
    by the peisk_bluetoothIsConnectable function, and is used by the
    connectionMangager to determine which devices should connect to
    which.

    See also \ref LinkLayer "the link layer" and
    \ref Hello "HELLO connections"
