/** \defgroup peis Ecologies of PEIS project

  The Ecologies of PEIS Project uses a number of different programs
  which are running on a number of different computers and robots. All
  these different programs have been developed to accomplish one
  specific task each, and by communicating and collaborating with each
  other these programs can together accomplish much more advanced
  tasks. In a way, the funding principle for the Ecologies of PEIS
  project is very similar to the  UNIX philosphy .  

  These different programs are all tied together using the peiskernel
  software library for communication and collaboration. As such, they
  all (should) accept the following common set of commandline options.

  peiskernel options:
  - --peis-id int                Specify an address to be used in the peis network
  - --peis-name name             Alternative name of component
  - --peis-user name             Alternative name of user
  - --peis-hostname name         Alternative name of host computer
  - --peis-port port             Select port for incomming connections
  - --peis-connect url           Specify an initial start connection to be used
  - --peis-debug-packages        Generates a lot of debug information
  - --peis-debug-routes          Print debuging information for routing tables
  - --peis-load file             Load extra commandlines from file
  - --peis-leaf                  Leaf node only allowing connections to localhost(s)
  - --peis-silent                Suppress all printouts to stdout
  - --peis-time-master           Overrides time synchronisation of ecology
  - --peis-package-loss float    Introduces an artifical package loss for debugging
  - --peis-print-status          Enable printing status info (default off)
  - --peis-print-connections     Enable printing connection info (default off)
  - --peis-print-package-errors  Enable printing package errors (default off)
  - --peis-print-tuple-errors    Enable printing tuple errors (default off)
  - --peis-print-debug-steps     Enable printing out lots of debugging steps (default off)
  - --peis-print-warnings        Enable printing of misc warnings about which only Mathias cares about
  - --peis-print-port-statistics Lots of port statistics that only Mathias cares about
  - --peis-network string        Set network connection string (default default)
  - --peis-set-tuple key value   Assign tuple value to key
  - --peis-net-metric value      Cost to communicate over network (default 2)
  - --peis-bluetooth device      Use given bluetooth adaptor

   The PEIS kernel is a software library written in pure C and with
   as few library dependencies as possible. The purpose of this
   library is to enable software programs to participate as PEIS
   components in the PEIS Ecology network. 

  Users of the peiskernel should primarily see the \ref tuples
  "Tuplespace layer" and/or the 
  \ref peiskmt "multithreaded Peis Kernel" for the basic
  operations of how to use this library.   

  Developers, or expert users, may also want to read up on the
  different modules and layers that implement the peiskernel. You may
  want to start with the \ref peisk "Peis Kernel" module.  

  Note that some of this documentation is only generated from the
  Doxygen.private file in the sourcecode.
