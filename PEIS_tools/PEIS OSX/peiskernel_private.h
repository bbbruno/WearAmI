/** @file peiskernel_private.h
    \brief Defines private interfaces to the peiskernel library.

    This header file is included by all internal code of the
    peiskernel, and can be included by some very specific middleware
    components such as the tupleview or peisinit - but should never be
    included by other user components. If you realy need to access some
    internal functions/variables of the peiskernel this might be a
    fault of the API and I would appreciate to be contacted with the
    reasoning behind - perhaps major change to the library will be needed
    then.

/** \defgroup peisk The PEIS kernel
    The PEIS kernel is a software library written in pure C and with
    as few library dependencies as possible. The purpose of this
    library is to enable software programs to participate as PEIS
    components in the PEIS Ecology network.  

    Internally, the PEIS kernel consists of a number of modules, which
    can loosely be organized as a number of layers providing
    services to higher layes, and in the end the software
    application. 
    These layers are:

    - The \ref LinkLayer "link layer" which provides basic
      communication channels between different software instances on
      the same computer, or distributed on any computers on a ethernet
      network or connectable by bluetooth connections. 
    - The \ref P2PLayer "P2P layer" which creates an ad-hoc P2P
      network ontop of all available network links in order to let any
      PEIS component in the ecology communicate with any other
      components. 
    - The \ref tuples "Tuple layer" which implements the basic
      tuplespace on top of the P2P layer. Although this layer provides the core
      of the services used by applications, some of the other library
      function are of use in some applications. 

      For a complete list of all modules in the peiskernel, see the
      Doxygen page for software modules.
